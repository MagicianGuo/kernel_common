/// permission to manipulate the `next`/`prev` pointers stored in the refcounted object. By ensuring
/// that each object has only one `ListArc` reference, the owner of that reference is assured
/// exclusive access to the `next`/`prev` pointers. When a `ListArc` is inserted into a `List`, the
/// `List` takes ownership of the `ListArc` reference.

/// simplest is to convert a [`UniqueArc`] into a `ListArc`. However, the refcounted object could
/// also keep track of whether a `ListArc` exists using a boolean, which could allow for the
/// creation of new `ListArc` references from an [`Arc`] reference. Whatever strategy is used, the
/// relevant tracking is referred to as "the tracking inside `T`", and the [`ListArcSafe`] trait
/// (and its subtraits) are used to update the tracking when a `ListArc` is created or destroyed.
